# Purpose

1. To formally document the grammar (in a PEG grammar) of the commonly used NES assemblers
2. To create an assembler that can assemble any of these
3. To create a convertor from one variant to another

# Notable assemblers

Assemblers which have either been used with published homebrew source, a significant commented disassembly of a commerical game, or published commercial source

* NESASM

## Others

* NESHLA - comprehensive documentation and used by its author for Retro City Rampage, but no indication of use by others
* Xkas - One of the older assemblers, but seems to be more of an SMWCentral thing. NES disassemblies aren't notable (e.g. barely commentated ones for Megaman 3, 4, 5)
